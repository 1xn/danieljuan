This is my first website hosted on github pages. Enforced SSL encryption courtesy of Let's Encrypt.

Thanks to Github for the amazing community and learning experience! **I am finally** learning how to commit and push to repositories via terminal.

And also thanks to Hostalia for the amazing 0.29â‚¬ domain names (cheap!)

Yay! ðŸ¥° Greetingz to *Klaoe & Metakid*
